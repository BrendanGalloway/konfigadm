* jrei/systemd-ubuntu:18.04
* jrei/systemd-debian:9
* jrei/systemd-debian:latest
* jrei/systemd-centos:7
* jrei/systemd-fedora:latest


## Features


* Dependency free and easily embeddable into an image builder.
* Has built-in higher-order abstractions for kubernetes, containers, cri, cni, etc.
* Declarative, The order of operations cannot be changed, there are no implicit or explicit dependencies between items, no conditionals (besides for os/cloud tags) or control flows
* Typed, can validate the configuration(e.g. docker image name is valid, systemd.unit file only includes valid keys, and the values are typed correctly)
* Supports multiple operating systems and package managers.
* Abstractions and many of the built-in elements are easily unit-testable due to the use of virtual filesystem and command execution list.
* Automatic testing based on the declarations (If I have declared a service, I can automatically test if that service is running and health (or crash-looping), If I declare a container runtime, ensure that I can connect to it via itâ€™s client )
* Generate cloud-init or shell scripts to be used by other systems
